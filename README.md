# LinkFollower

A simple program written as an exercise in learning some basic Elixir.

It's purpose is to extract ```<a>``` tags from an HTML document and allow the user to choose one to follow.  This will fetch the linked page and continue the cycle.  It doesn't really perform anything useful. :)

## Installation

```bash
mix escript.build
./linkfollower http://google.com
```
